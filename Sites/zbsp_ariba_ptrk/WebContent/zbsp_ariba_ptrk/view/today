Good afternoon everyone, nice to meet you all. 
Today we are going to talk about an application that we developed to facilitate 
the monitoring of the integrations between SAP and Ariba, so For this, 
we developed our custom integration monitor. 
I will start providing some technical details and if you have any questions at any time 
feel free to ask me.
The version of this monitor is hosted directly in the SAP environment, 
so to access the application each user must have an SAP user.
At the top of the page there are some filters. First, a filter to select whether 
you want to see all types of messages or just errors. 
You can also put a specific ID to filter on all records and 
a date range to select, click the apply button and the application  will find the corresponding data.
There are a program on SAP side scheduled to run every 30 minutes 
to update the data in our custom tables. This program reads all log data 
saved by the integration with CI9 or CIG. 
In the next section there are some charts. In the left part of the screen, the application 
shows a percentage of integrations completed with errors and success. On the right part, 
information about the SLP module is shown with all status in the registration, 
qualification and integration sections.
The next sections are divided by ariba modules,

Starting with the commerce automation, 
the purchase orders created are listed here, with the order number, date and link to IDOC 
and XML file sent to Ariba. 
When the user clicks on the link he is redirected to the SAP Web pages and the information 
is displayed in a new tab. I will click to show an example. This visualization structure 
will repeat in all documents, with Id and links to get detailed information on a specific line. 
Shown below is the order confirmation interface. 
The first column shows the suppliers id, and the next columns shows the link to get the 
XML file and the link to the SAP document. 
The integration of supplier service sheet 
is similar to order confirmation, with the same type of information, but in this scenario 
the response interface is shown below. 
The latest integration of Ariba Network is the 
payments interface, with the document number and corresponding status.
Now is shown the information about buying integrations. The first is about the purchase 
requisitions created on Ariba and sent to SAP ERP. For this integration the applications 
consumes an API to get information and show the number of requisitions, and some status, 
with an link to access the document on Ariba side.
Below is shown the import requisition interface, with purchase requisitions created on 
SAP and sent to Ariba. For this scenario on this customer, we have a custom table with 
specific status. The last two integrations are about purchase order creation, 
with information from Ariba and the corresponding SAP order number.
And the latest information is about the master data integration. 
The first table shows the interface that sent data to Ariba and the other table show 
the status of each process files on Ariba, with percentages and number of lines created, 
updated and deleted.
